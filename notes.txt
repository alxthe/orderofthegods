MAKE FILES FOR EACH FEATURE, MAKE SURE 

test often

save actively

use sonnet

METAPROMPTING as the kickoff: the most important words are the first four words of the prompt, use opus to metaprompt
- build me the best prompt you can to use the AI tools (to the best of your ability), build the app how i have asked you to based off of the docs
- have it stop if it has any questions or is unsure in ANY WAY POSSIBLE
- don't make too many features
- for each major phase you stop at, create the ability to test
- update its memory bank (every problem it encounters, add everything you have learned from bugfixing to pitfalls)

REMEMBER:
- git add ., git commit -m, git push
- update memory bank
- test

STORY INTRO SCENES

LEVEL 1
- powers for one person

LEVEL 2
- powers for 3 people

LEVEL 3
- powers for all people

LEVEL 4
- BOSS FIGHT WITH THE FATES TO TURN INTO A GOD


ADD SONGS!!!


make sure level 1 only uses level 1 creatures: chimera, hydra, medusa, minotaur, sphinx

and make sure the medusa has her superpower (right as she comes on not after you serve her)

make sure level 2 only uses its creatures

also make cutting take 3 seconds

make sure the dev button works because right now, I have to click the button and then I have to serve another food for it to change. But once I hit the button, it should just change to the next level. it should just add 10 points to the value. so it should also work if i want to go to level 3 or 4

And whenever I hit 10 points, make sure it has a little animation saying "You've completed the feast hall and now we're moving to the Acropolis from Athens. You will encounter a new food. People to serve or something like that." 

Get rid of the word "table" on the divine preperation table

and make sure the circles in the tbale are not too close to each other and are within the table. it looks good now but its on the edge so make it fit well

AFTER YOU TIME OUT IT STILL GLITCHES please fix that. it scrambles through different riddles and people so please fix it

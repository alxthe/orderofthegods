# TIMEOUT SCRAMBLING BUG FIX - TESTING GUIDE

## 🐛 Bug Fixed: Frame-Rate Dependent Timeout Scrambling

**Root Cause**: Timer timeout code was executing 60 times per second while `timer <= 0`, creating 150+ simultaneous setTimeout calls that all fired together, causing rapid customer cycling.

**Solution**: Added `timeoutInProgress` flag to ensure exactly ONE timeout is created per timer expiry.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Added Protection Flag (`js/game-state.js`)
```javascript
// Anti-timeout-spam protection
timeoutInProgress: false,    // Prevent multiple timeout creation (CRITICAL FIX)
```

### 2. Modified Timeout Logic (`js/main.js`)
- Added condition: `if (game.timer <= 0 && !game.timeoutInProgress)`
- Set flag to `true` when creating timeout
- Reset flag to `false` when timeout completes
- Added debug logging to track timeout creation

### 3. Flag Resets in Critical Functions (`js/gameplay.js`)
- `nextRiddle()` - Reset at completion
- `startGame()` - Reset at game start
- `restartLevel()` - Reset at level restart
- All level advancement functions - Reset before advancing
- All timeout cleanup locations - Reset when clearing timeouts

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Timeout (Most Important)
1. Start a riddle in any level
2. **DO NOT deliver anything** - let timer reach zero
3. Wait for "TIMED OUT!!!" message
4. **VERIFY**: Only ONE customer change occurs
5. **VERIFY**: No rapid cycling through multiple customers
6. Console should show only ONE "🕐 Creating timeout" message

### Test 2: Cross-Level Testing
Repeat Test 1 for all levels:
- Level 1 (Creatures)
- Level 2 (Heroes) 
- Level 3 (Gods)
- Level 4 does not have riddle timeouts (boss fight only)

### Test 3: Performance Verification
1. Open browser console
2. Let timer expire
3. Look for debug messages:
   - Should see: `🕐 Creating timeout - timeoutInProgress: true` (ONCE)
   - Should NOT see: Multiple timeout creation messages
   - Should see: `🔄 Timeout completed, flag reset` (ONCE)

### Test 4: Edge Cases
1. **Level advancement during timeout**: Advance level while timeout is in progress
2. **Game restart during timeout**: Restart game while timeout is in progress  
3. **Pause/unpause during timeout**: Test pause functionality during timeout

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] **Single timeout only**: Only one customer change per timer expiry
- [ ] **No scrambling**: No rapid cycling through multiple customers
- [ ] **Performance**: Only 1 setTimeout created per timeout (not 150+)
- [ ] **Cross-level consistency**: Fix works on all levels
- [ ] **No regressions**: All other game functionality still works
- [ ] **Clean console logs**: No spam of timeout creation messages

## 🔍 Debug Verification

Watch console for these messages:
```
✅ GOOD: "🕐 Creating timeout - timeoutInProgress: true" (appears once)
✅ GOOD: "🔄 Timeout completed, flag reset" (appears once)
❌ BAD: Multiple "🕐 Creating timeout" messages
❌ BAD: Rapid customer name changes in console
```

## 🚨 Critical Importance

This was a **frame-rate dependent bug**:
- 60 fps = 150 timeouts created in 2.5 seconds
- 120 fps = 300 timeouts created in 2.5 seconds
- The fix ensures exactly 1 timeout regardless of framerate

## 🎯 Files Modified

1. `js/game-state.js` - Added `timeoutInProgress` flag
2. `js/main.js` - Protected timeout creation logic
3. `js/gameplay.js` - Added flag resets in 12+ locations

The fix is comprehensive and should eliminate the timeout scrambling issue completely!
